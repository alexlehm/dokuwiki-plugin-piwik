=====================

Dokuwiki plugin for Piwik Tag Manager

Project page: https://www.lehmann.cx/wiki/projects:dokuwiki_piwik

For feedback please create an issue https://github.com/alexlehm/dokuwiki-plugin-piwik/issues

The plugin supports a Piwik tag with live or dev/staging code, just
use the code after container_ before ".js".

The code can be live or stage/dev, the stage/dev code has more letters
after the tag code like ABCD_dev_1234abcd

The tag does not define a Data Layer, if you need to access it before
the tag is loaded, you can use the definition described in the piwik
documentation.
